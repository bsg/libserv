libserv - A cross-platform non-blocking TCP server library

Copy serv.c and serv.h into your source folder and include serv.h

Windows users, in addition to the above, need to link ws2_32.dll.

Please see example.c for usage. Documentation coming soon.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The project is still a work in progress. The software is not
tested thoroughly and should not be used in a serious project.
